# splenic artery embolization
---


> [!info] definition
> a

### clinical indications
- hemodynamically unstable –> **operative management**
- **non-operative management** (medical +/- embolization)
	- first employed in peds in the 1970s, but has become standard of care in HDS adults
	- generally involves admission to the ICU or step-down unit with continuous monitoring fo vitals
- decision to embolize is multifactorial — involves assessment of transfusion requirements, degree/type of splenic injury, presence of intraparenchymal/intraperitoneal contrast extravasation

#### blunt trauma
- hemodynamically stable patient with active bleeding
- AAST grade III or higher injury
- large amount of hemoperitoneum

##### conventional therapy
typically **laparotomy with [[splenectomy\|splenectomy]] or splenorrhaphy** (suturing closed) — remains the standard of care for hemodynamically unstable patients and may be required in cases of failure of nonoperative management
- most significant long-term risk: infection (encapsulated organisms)
	- 
- post-splenectomy sepsis is more common cases of elective splenectomy for hematologic disorders, but also occurs in ~ 0.5% post-trauma patients

#### penetrating trauma
- limited role for angio in penetrating splenic trauma – generally require laparotomy

#### thrombocytopenia


### contraindications
#### absolute
- hemodynamic instability

#### relative
- preexisting splenic disease
- multisystem trauma
- associated diaphragmatic or hollow viscous injury

### relevant anatomy & physiology

> [!tip] note
> order of frequency of injured abdominal organs:
> 1. spleen
> 2. liver
> 3. kidneys
> 4. small bowel/mesentery
> 5. bladder
> 6. colon/rectum
> 7. diaphragm
> 8. pancreas
> 9. major vessels

- overlooked splenic injury is the most common cause of preventable death in trauma patients
- CT w IV contrast routinely obtained following trauma and should be carefully analyzed for injury

Arterial supply to spleen is **splenic artery**, which gives rise to several non-splenic branches before dividing into the terminal branches at the splenic hilum
- first 2 major branches: [[dorsal pancreatic artery\|dorsal pancreatic artery]] & [[greater bancreatic artery\|greater bancreatic artery]] (supply the body and tail)
	- many smaller unnamed branches supplying the body and tail of the pancreas also arise
- the [[posterior gastric artery\|posterior gastric artery]], which supplies the posterior gastric body, is not uniformly present and has variable origin
	- < 50% arise from the splenic artery
- the [[left gastroepiploic artery\|left gastroepiploic artery]] (to tail of the pancreas) and variable short gastric arteries arise from the distal spenic artery or its terminal branches at the hilum
	- left gastroepiploic supplies the greater curvature of the stomach and omentum
	- short gastric arteries (4-5) supply the gastric fundus and anastamose with branches of the left gastric artery and left gastroepiploic

### procedure
- can be performed 
	- proximally within the splenic artery
	- distally wihin intraparenchymal splenic artery branches
	- combination of the two techniques
- **proximal SAE**
	- generally performed with deployment of coils or vascular plug **beyond the dorsal pancreatic artery origin** but **proximal to the terminal splenic artery branches**
	- <u>purpose</u>: to decrease splenic arterial pressure while allowing distal reconstitution of the splenic artery via collaterals to prevent splenic infarction
	- often preferred in setting of high-grade trauma without focal arterial abnormality at angiography
- **distal SAE**
	- performed after angiographic localization of a focal arterial abnormality and selective catheterizationi of the involved intraparenchymal segmental splenic artery branch
	- may be performed with a variety of agents: microparticles, liquid embolics, coils
	- associated with splenic **infarction**
- **combined proximal & distal SAE**
	- generally reserved for grade IV or V AAST splenic injuries or large hemoperitoneum

#### pre-procedure preparation


#### technique
1. [[seldinger technique\|seldinger technique]] used to access (usually the femoral artery) using an 18- or 21-gauge needle, with or without US guidance
2. celiac axis catheterization with a 5 Fr catheter or a coaxial microcatheter, followed by digital subtraction angiography of the celiac & splenic artery
3. splenic artery is selected with either a 5Fr catheter or a coaxial microcatheter
4. depending on the type and extent of injury, embolization is performed
	- **proximal embolization**: coils or a vascular plug are deployed in the splenic artery trunk distal to the dorsal pancreatic artery but proximal to the distal splenic branches
	- **distal embolization**: a microcatheter system is advanced into the abnormal intraparenchymal segmental splenic artery and embolization is performed with agent of choice
	- **combined**: distal should be performed first
5. post-embolization angiography is performed from the celiac axis or proximal splenic artery through the 5Fr catheter to ensure 
	- vessel occlusion with proximal embolization and/or resolution of extravasation with distal occlusion has been achieved
	- absence of additional angiographic abnormalities warranting treatment

#### post-procedure



### outcomes
- clinical success rate ~90% for SAE management of splenic trauma
	- proximal SAE with coil embolization in the setting of trauma has technical success rate 90-95%, similar rates of successfully avoiding splenectomy
- systematic review and metaanalyses have demonstrated no significant difference in rate of SAE failure or splenic rebleeding between proximal and distal SAE
- major or minor infarction of spleen requiring splenectomy are uncommon (regardless of prox v. distal), but minor splenic infarction occurs more commonly with distal SAE
	- one comparative review of 4 level-1 trauma centers showed that centers with the highest rates of embolization also enjoy the highest rates of splenic salvage
	- probability of successful preservation of the spleen is increased when embolization is used for grade 3 and 4 lacerations

### complications
- infarct
- abscess
- splenic rupture
- post-embolization syndrome
- nontarget embolization of the pancreas
- persistent hemorrhage
