# transarterial radioembolization (tare)
---

> [!info] definition
> delivery of radioactive microspheres directly into an artery that perfuses a tumor or tumor-bearing tissue such that microspheres become lodged within and around tumor to cause tumor cell death through the effects of radiation
> in current practice, it is employed mostly for liver tumors

### overview



> [!help] terminology
> - **[[radiation segmentectomy\|radiation segmentectomy]]**: segmental tare using intentionally ablative doses of Y-90 radiomicrospheres
> - **[[radiation lobectomy\|radiation lobectomy]]**: lobar tare done with the intent to develop marked ipsilateral lobar atrophy, resulting in 
> 	- the management of potential microvascular and macrovascular spread of disease
> 	- potential contralateral lobe hypertrophy

### clinical indications
> [!aside|right] 
> indicators of adequate hepatic reserve
> - total bilirubin ≤ 2 mg/dL
> - albumin > 3 g/cL
> - normal INR

> [!aside|right] ecog

determining eligibility requires assessment of disease burden, biochemical parameters of liver function, and performance status
- liver-only or liver-dominant primary or metastatic disease with a tumor burden involving **< 50%** of the liver
- indicators of adequate hepatic reserve
- minimal cancer-related symptoms, with ECOG **0-2**

#### glass microspheres
TheraSphere was approved by US FDA in 1999 under a humanitarian device exemption, defined as safe and probably beneficial for 
- treatment of **unresectable [[hepatocellular carcinoma\|HCC]]** with or without [[portal vein thrombosis\|portal vein thrombosis]]
- bridge to transplantation

(also approved for treatment of liver neoplasia in Europe and Canada)

#### resin microspheres
SIR-Spheres were granted premarket approval by the US FDA in 2002, defined as safe and effective for treatment of **metastatic [[colorectal cancer\|colorectal cancer]]** to the liver with concomitant use of [[floxuridine\|floxuridine]]

#### alternatives
##### [[transarterial chemoembolization\|TACE]]

##### ablation

##### surgical resection


##### systemic chemotherapy
- three major phase iii RCTs comparing resin-based TARE with sorafenib
	- have failed to demonstrate statistical superiority of TARE (OS, PFS)
	- TARE group experienced better tumor response, improved quality of life, decreased toxicity[^1]
- subsequent post hoc analysis: median survival was longer for participants who received radiation dose to tumor > 100 Gy than for those who received ≤ 100 Gy (14.1 mo vs 6.1 mo)

##### liver transplantation

### contraindications
#### absolute
- contraindications to angiography
	- uncorrectable coagulopathy
	- severe renal insufficiency
	- severe anaphylactoid reaction to iodinated contrast agents
	- severe peripheral vascular disease precluding arterial access
- immediate life-threatening extrahepatic disease
- inability to prevent Y90 delivery to the GI tract
- hepatopulmonary lung shunting
	- TheraSphere: limitation based on **lung dose**, *NOT* [[lung shunt fraction\|lung shunt fraction]] (30Gy per infusion, 50Gy cumulative)
	- SIR-Spheres: infusion limited by lung shunt fraction (20%)

#### relative
- portal vein thrombosis (pvt)
	- patients with *main* portal vein thrombosis have poor prognosis
		- child-pugh a patients with main pvt can be safely treated
	- NOT contraindicated in lobar or segmental pvt
- poor hepatic reserve
	- total bilirubin >2 mg/dL
	- risks may be mitigated by *selective* radioembolization
- poor performance status (ECOG >2)
- biliary obstruction
	- risk of infectious complications significantly higher in the setting of comprimised [[sphincter of oddi\|sphincter of oddi]]

### relevant anatomy & pathophysiology

> - post-embolization syndrome

#### steps
##### pretreatment angiography
done to define hepatic arterial anatomy, allow embolization of communicating vessels that may lead to aberrant microsphere deposition, and facilitate radiation dosimetry
- abdominal aorta (pigtail catheter; 15mL/sec for 30mL)
	- allows for evaluation of celiac axis, SMA and renal artery patency, aortic tortuosity, and guiding proper visceral catheter selection
- SMA (reverse curve catheter; 3mL/sec for 30mL)
	- allows for identification of a [[replaced right hepatic artery\|replaced right hepatic artery]], [[replaced proper hepatic artery\|replaced proper hepatic artery]], [[replaced common hepatic artery\|replaced common hepatic artery]], [[accessory right hepatic artery\|accessory right hepatic artery]], and patency of the portal vein
	- allows for evaluation for rare parasitization of blood flow from SMA to liver
	- allows for assessment of retrograde flow (from tumor sumping or celiac occlusion/stenosis) into GDA
- celiac artery (reverse curve catheter; 3-4mL/sec for 12-15mL)
	- allows for assessment of celiac anatomy and identifies the presence of variants, including a replaced left hepatic off the left gastric (gastrohepatic trunk), as well as the right and left inferior phrenic arteries
	- dorsal pancreatic artery may arise off the celiac
- common hepatic artery (microcatheter; 3mL/sec for 10-12mL)
	- arterial branches of note (which may require embolization) arising off the common hepatic artery: **right gastric, dorsal pancreatic, and gastroduodenal**
	- other complex variants:
		- replaced right hepatic artery off the SMA, with trifurcation from the CHA into a GDA, left hepatic, and middle hepatic arteries
			- in such cases, right gastric often seen and unless segmental infusions of radioembolization are planned, GDA/right gastric should be embolized (functionally converts CHA into left hepatic)
		- trifurcation of CHA into GDA, right, and left hepatic arteries
			- given low margin of error if reflux occurs from a lobar or segmental infusion, GDA should be embolized in this case, particularly if the more embolic resin microsphere are being admninistered
		- “double hepatic” artery: very early takeoff of the right hepatic artery
			- unless sufficient contrast is injected and refluxed to the origin of the celiac, this vessel may be missed
- gastroduodenal artery (microcatheter; 2mL/sec for 8mL)
	- vessels sought include 
		- accessory cystic artery
		- superior pacreaticoduodenal
		- parasitization of flow to liver from GDA or from its branches (right gastroepiploic, omental/epiploic branches)
		- accessory hepatic arteries (usually providing flow to segments 5 or 6)
	- routine prophylactic embolization of ***GDA no longer recommended***, but given clinically inconsequential effects, should be considered when resing microspheres are being delivered with the microcatheter positioned in close proximity to the origin of the GDA
		- settings in which GDA might NOT be embolized include where there is 
			- parasitization of flow to the liver that may require future catheterization and radioembolization
			- retrograde flow from the SMA from either hyperdynamic flow or celiac stenosis
		- in cases of GDA presentation, embo of all distal vessels except the one feeding tumors is recommended if possible, essentially converting GDA into an accessory hepatic vessel feeding tumor
		- If complete embo of GDA undertaken, should be embolized to the origin of the vessel because small very rpoximal GDA branches may hypertrophy in response to incomplete embolization
- proper hepatic angiogram (microcatheter; 3mL/sec for 12mL)
	- injection of this vessel at this rate will often result in supraphysiologic flow rates and reflux, but will opacity small and often overlooked vessels (e.g. **[[right gastric artery\|right gastric artery]]**)
- left hepatic angiogram (microcatheter; 2mL/sec for 8mL)
	- vessels of interest: left inferior phrenic artery, accessory left gastric artery, inferior esophageal artery, right gastric artery, and the falciform artery
	- prophylactic embolization of these vessels may decrease adverse events following radioembolization, such as abdominal pain, gastritis, and ulceration
	- delayed imaging of the left hepatic angiogram recommended in order to confirm lack of opacification of the coronary vein
	- injection of the left hepatic artery should outline where there is flow to segment 4 via the medial branch
		- if medial branch absent, a separate middle hepatic artery should be sought, usually
- right hepatic angiogram (microcatheter; 2-3mL/sec for 10-12mL)
	- vessels of interest: middle hepatic artery, supraduodenal, and cystic artery
- phrenic arteries (microcatheter; 1-2mL/sec for 4-6mL)
	- if a portion of the liver tumor (especially HCC) is not opacified by hepatic arteriography, interrogating these vessels may identify the remainder of the blood supply to the tumors

##### macroaggregated albumin (maa) administration
> [!tip] note
> **lung shunt fraction** = fraction of Tc-99m MAA observed in the lungs relative to the total Tc-99m activity observed

- lung shunt fraction can be determined by infusing 4-5 mCi of Tc-99m-labeled MAA particles through catheter into the desired liver distribution and obtaining planar imaging
- MAA scan can also demonstrate presence of any stomach or bowel perfusion, especially if SPECT imaging is perfromed (thus recommended that <u>MAA injection be performed once all vessels of concern have been embolized</u>)
	- allows physician to plan radioembolization, minimize uncertainty in microsphere distribution

##### dosimetry
###### glass microspheres
as described in product insert, TheraSphere consists of insoluble glass microspheres where Y-90 is an integral constituent of the glass
- mean sphere diametere ranging from 20-30 μm
- each milligram contains 22,000-73,000 microspheres
- supplied in 0.05 mL sterile, pyrogen-free water contained in a 0.3 mL vee-bottom vial secured within a 12mm clear acrylic vial shield
- dispensed weekly by manufacturer (BTG, London, UK) on wednesdays, calibrated for noon EST of the following sunday
- availabel in activity sizes 3 GBq (81 mCi) to 20 GBq (540 mCi)
	- activity per microsphere ~2,500 Bq

recommended activity of TheraSphere that should be delivered to a lobe of the liver containing tumor si 80 Gy to 150 Gy (wide range to give physician flexibility)
- patients with significant cirrhosis / less functional liver should be treated more conservatively (80-100 Gy)
- patients without cirrhosis may be treated more aggressively (100-150 Gy)

assuming the microspheres distribute in a uniform manner throughout the liver and Y–90 undergoes complete decay *in situ*, radioactivity required to deliver the desired dose to the liver can be calculated with the following:

$$ A (GBq) = [D (Gy) \times M (kg)] / 50 $$

given that a fraction of the microspheres will flow into the pulmonary circulation without lodging in the arterioles, when LSF is taken into account, the actual dose delivered to the target volume becomes

$$ D (Gy) = [A (GBq) \times 50 \times (1-LSF)] / M (kg) $$

where A = activity delivered to the liver, D = absorbed liver dose to target liver mass, and M = target liver mass
(liver volume is estimated with CT, then converted to mass using a conversion factor of **1.03 mg/mL**)

<br>

> [!tip] note
> dosimetry for TheraSphere is independent of tumor burden!

###### resin microspheres
as described in the product insert, SIR-Spheres consist of biocompatible resin-based microspheres containing Y-90 with a size between 20μm and 60μm in diameter
- permanent implant 
- provided in a vial with water: each vial = 3GBq of Y-90 (at time of calibration) in a total of 5mL water for injection
	- each vial has 40-80 million microspheres
	- activity per microsphere much lower than that of TheraSphere (50 Bq vs 2500 Bq, respectively)
- dispensed 3 times per week by manufacturer (Sirtex, Lane Cove, Australia) and are calibrated for 6pm EST on date of treatment (shelf life 24h following calibration date and time)

like TheraSphere, assuming SIR-Sphere microspheres distribute in a uniform manner throughout the liver and undergo complete decay in situ, radioactivity delivered to the liver can be calculated incorporating **body surface area** (BSA) and **estimate of tumor burden** as follows: 

$$ A(GBq) = BSA(m^2) - 0.2 + (\% tumor involvement / 100) $$

##### radioembolization
- selected catheter is advanced into treatment vessel of choice as determined by pretreatment angio, and either the TheraSphere or SIR-Sphere administration device is utilized for infusion
- a treatment paradigm that parallels transarterial chemoembolization is recommended (that is, lobar or sub/segmental infusions)
	- if a treating physician insists on treatment to the entire liver at once, then a “bilobar lobar” infusion is recommended (placement of catheter in the one followed by the other hepatic artery where infusion is performed)

![[Pasted image 20230130105223.png\|Pasted image 20230130105223.png]]

#### postprocedure management
##### outpatient management
- patients discharged home following appropriate management of femoral arteriotomy
	- 2 hours with closure devices
	- 6 hours with manual compression
- patients may receive 7-10 days of a **fluoroquinolone** if entire right lobe is to be treated and gallbladder is present
- all patients placed on a **proton pump inhibitor** for 7-10 following treatment

##### follow-up
- <u>clinical assessment</u>: patients assessed for
	- treatment-related side effects: fatigue, nausea, fevers, abdominal pain
	- potential complications: [[radiation cholecystitis\|radiation cholecystitis]], gastrointestinal ulcer
- <u>labs</u>: obtained **4-6 weeks postprocedure**
	- tumor markers (AFP, CEA, CA-19-9, chromogranin A, CA-125)
	- CBC
	- LFTs
	- BMP
- <u>imaging</u>
	- cross-sectional (triphasic CT, dynamic gadolinium-enhanced MRI) and functional imaging (PET) when appropriate are obtained at that time to assess results of therapy
	- opposite lobe is usually treated shortly following assessment of response
	- completion evaluation and assessment of response (CT/PET/MR/tumor markers) usually complete once both lobes have been treated and 30-60 days have elapsed from the last treatment

### outcomes
#### hcc
- median survival comparable to chemoembolization for intermediate stage patients (17mo; range 16.9-18mo) and to sorafenib for advanced stage patients (11mo; range 10-13.8mo)
- quality of life (esp social and functional well-being) higher with radioembolization when compared to chemoembolization
- treatment in patients with PVT safe, with median survival 8-14mo
	- outcomes optimized when tumor radiation does exceeds 205Gy

![[Pasted image 20230424182312.png\|Pasted image 20230424182312.png]]

#### metastatic colorectal disease to the liver
- median survival in **salvage** setting (after failing minimum second line systemic therapies) ~10.5mo
- novel concepts in combo with chemotherapy studied — trials combining radioembo with 1st or 2nd-line chemo underway

#### cholangiocarcinoma
- median survival ~11mo, similar to systemic therapy (gemcitabine and cisplatin)
- peripheral (mass-forming) CCA may respond, whereas infiltrative does not

#### flr augmentation
- 




### complications & management
- **post-radioembolization syndrome**
	- fatigue, abdominal pain, nausea, anorexia, fevers
	- if typical side effects, managed conservatively
	- if required, over-the-counter analgesics can be utilized
- idiosyncratic reaction
	- during immediate postprocedural time after radioembolization, patients may experience a rare reaction nearly identical to that obtained in a patient receiving urokinase, with clinical symptoms of **rigors** and **alterations in hemodynamics**
	- management is supportive: fluids if hypotensive, diphenhydramine, meperidine
- complications of procedural steps
	- **abscess**: pyogenic liver abscesses require antibiotic therapy directed at causative organism + drainage in most cases
		- if small, antibiotics without drainage may suffice
	- **biloma**:
