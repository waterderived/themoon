# PRESERVE trial
---


### clinical question
Aim: To characterize the current practice of IVC filter placement, including the indications, filter type, frequency and success of filter removal, safety of placement initially and in the long term, including filter mechanical stability and caval patency, and the frequency of subsequent episodes of PE and recurrence of DVT. 

### bottom line
> The PRESERVE (PREdicting the Safety and Effectiveness of inferioR VEna cava filters) protocol, including formulation of a plan for VCF retrieval at placement and frequent reevaluation of patients for possible VCF removal thereafter, resulted in a high rate of VCF removal.

### major points
- Only 23 clinically significant, nonfatal pulmonary emboli were diagnosed following vena cava filter (VCF) placement in 1421 patients, of whom 1019 (71.7%) had current venous thromboembolism at the time of placement
- Clinically significant VCF-related adverse events were rare. Post-VCF placement deep vein thromboses (DVTs) were diagnosed in 74 (5.2%) and caval occlusions in 15 (1.1%) patients
- VCFs were removed from 632 of 640 (98.8%) patients who underwent attempted removal, 620 (96.8%) at first attempt

### guidelines


### design
- multi-center, prospective, non-randomized, open-label trial
- n = 1429
- setting: 54 sites in US
- enrollment: 2015 - 2019
- follow-up: 3 mo, 12 mo, 24 mo
- analysis: 
- primary outcomes
	- **primary safety endpoint**: 
		- freedom from serious AEs within perioperative period 
		- freedom from clinically significant perforation, VCF embolization, caval thrombotic occlusion, and/or new DVT within first 12 mo following VCF placement
	- **primary effectiveness endpoint**: 
		- procedural and technical success 
		- freedom from new clinically significant PE (symptomatic, confirmed by imaging) at 12 mo in situ or 1 mo postretrieval, whicever came first
- secondary outcomes
	- mechanical stability = absence of following at time of retrieval or each follow-up
	- freedom from PE (was not stratified to those who did or did not receive anticoagulation)

PSE and PEE
- PSE: 89.4%
- PEE: 96.4%
- lower limits of CI exceeded preplanned performance goals

#### secondary outcomes


#### adverse events

##### procedure-related and 30-day AEs
- 30 implantation prcedural AE in 28 patients (2%)
- of the 27 clinically significant AEs reported within 30 days after VCF placement
	- 1 pt died of unknown causes
	- 1 pt died of “undifferentiated shock”
	- 1 pt with PE at presemtation, died of hypoxia 3d later
- new or worsened DVT in 8 patients

##### VCF-related AEs
- 3 patients: migration > 20mm
- VCF retrieval
- AEs related to retrieval procedure
- new or worsened
