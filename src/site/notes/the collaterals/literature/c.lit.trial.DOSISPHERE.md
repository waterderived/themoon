> studyDesign:: multicenter, randomized phase II trial
> n:: 60
> survivalData:: personalized v. standard dosimetry — mOS (ITT): 26.6mo v. 10.7mo, 1y OS: 65.5% v 44.8%, 2y OS: 53.3% v. 22.3%
> radResponseData:: mPFS (ITT): 6.0mo v. 3.4mo, 3mo ORR (mITT): 71% v. 36%
> ae:: 20% (personalized) v. 33% (standard)
> keyFindings:: Personalized dosimetry offers better radiologic response and survival than standard dosimetry and is associated with fewer adverse events
> limitations:: small sample size, MAA as surrogate for microsphere debatable, only tumors ≥ 7cm included, questionable generalizability to resin
