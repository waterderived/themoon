### overview
#### types of tubes
- dedicated sing function (feeding vs. decompression alone)
	- [[percutaneous gastrostomy tube\|gastrostomy (g-tube)]]
		- simplest technically, requiring the least manipulation
		- shortest tube, providing for less clogging over time
		- preserves gastric function, allowing for high diet variety and simplicity in maintenance
		- can be converted into gastrojejunostomy (gj) tube after percutaneous tract matures (**10-21 days**)
	-  [[percutaneous jejunostomy tube placement\|jejunostomy (j-tube)]]
		- bypasses the stomach, requires elemental diet and slow pump infusion to prevent dumping syndrome
		- higher level of tube care required
		- for single-lumen GJ tubes:
			- catheter is placed via the stomach with tip at or beyond the ligament of Treitz
			- simpler to place under fluoroscopy than direct J-tube
			- longer catheter than direct J-tube, making it more prone to clogging
- split function 
	- [[percutaneous gastrojejunostomy tube placement\|double-lumen gastrojejunostomy]]
		- requires elemental diet and slow jejunal infusion using a pump
		- gastric lumen required for either of the following:
			- decompression in patients with [[gastroparesis\|gastroparesis]] or [[gastric outlet obstruction\|gastric outlet obstruction]]
			- medications that are only absorbed in the stomach
- [[percutaneous cecostomy tube placement\|cecostomy]]
