# percutaneous gastrostomy tube
---

> [!info] definition
> a type of [[percutaneous enteral tube placement\|enteric tube]] with internal tip in the lumen of the stomach used for feeding, medication administration, or venting



### indications
- nutritional support for patients with inadequate oral intake to due dysphagia, risk of aspiration, or obstruction secondary to
	- stroke / neuromuscular disorders
	- esophageal mass/neoplasm
	- lesions of the head, neck, and mediastinum (including recent surgery or radiation)
- diversion of feedings from esophageal leaks caused by recent surgery or trauma
- decompression of gastroenteric contents and/or need for jejunal feeding
	- gastric outlet or proximal [[small bowel obstruction\|small bowel obstruction]]
	- patients with [[gastroparesis\|gastroparesis]], e.g. diabetic gastropathy, [[scleroderma\|scleroderma]]
- intestinal access for biliary procedures (e.g. patients with Roux-en-Y anastomosis)

#### alternatives


### contraindications
#### absolute
- unsatisfactory anatomy, a.k.a. no safe window to access stomach due to interposed colon, liver
- uncorrectable coagulopathy

#### relative
- **prior gastric surgery** with anatomic distortion (e.g. subtotal gastrectomy or gastric bypass)
	- access to the stomach may be very difficult and require advanced techniques and/or CT guidance
- **massive [[ascites\|ascites]]** (though preprocedural paracentesis and gastropexy can help reduce incidence of peritoneal leakage) 
- **gastric or abdominal wall varices** due to portal hypertension
- **inflammatory, neoplastic, or infectious involvement of the gastric wall**: may result in <u>poor wound healing</u> and tract formation
- severe **gastroesophageal reflux**: feeding should instead be delivered into the jejunum via GJ tube or J tube
- [[ventriculoperitoneal shunt\|ventriculoperitoneal shunt]]

### relevant anatomy & pathophysiology


### preprocedure preparation
- review surgical history (prior abdominal/gastric surgery, etc)
- review prior imaging for evidence of altered gastric anatomy, safe percutaneous access route, and ascites
- review and correct any coagulopathy as needed
- \[OPT] ~200mL dilute barium suspension can be given 12h before the procedure to outline the colon
- maintain NPO ~8h prior to procedure
- an NG tube (preferably placed bedside the evening before procedure) is needed for insufflating air to bring the stomach into apposition with the anterior abdominal wall, displacing adjacent viscera, and facilitating creation of a safe window
	- alternatively, can place an angiographic catheter under fluoro immediately prior to the procedure to be used for insufflation

in patients with [[head and neck cancer\|head and neck malignancies]] and/or respiratory compromise:
- be judicious in giving conscious sedation ‚Äì this can be performed safely and comfortably with minimal sedation
- or maybe have anesthesia on hand if minimal conscious sedation is not possible

### procedure

> [!tech] g-tube for venting
> \[üìü **mccarthy**] often, the normal g-tubes tend to be **bad for venting** bc they are too short and gastric contents are dependent and collect posteriorly in a supine patient ‚Äî opt for a modified tube!

#### primary placement
##### tube choice
- <u>sizing</u>
- <u>brand</u>
	- **Entuit gastrostomy catheter** (Cook, Bloomington, IN)
	- Deutsch catheter (Cook)
	- 12Fr multipurpose locking loop multipurpose drainage catheter may also be used



> [!tech] on marking the liver
> **why do it?** ideally, you don't want the tract going through liver parenchyma 
> **does it really help?** preprocedure imaging and/or in-procedure cone beam are probably more useful, but it helps to have a general idea when trying to figure out where to stick

<br>

##### setup
- <u>prep</u>: L subcostal area + epigastrum
	- some attendings prefer whole upper abdomen
- \[OPT] US abdomen to check for and/or mark **liver margins** and **epigastrics**
- in a patient with significant ascites, perform **paracentesis**

##### steps
- when ready for insufflation, **glucagon** (0.5-1.0mg) or butylscopolamine (20mg) can be administered IV to diminish gastric peristalsis
- insufflate air into the stomach via NG until adequate gastric distension is achieved fluoroscopically
- following insufflation, **frontal and oblique views** (+ rarely a lateral view) of the upper abdomen are helpful to determine depth of the anterior gastric wall and location of the transverse colon
- select a puncture site, ideally over the **distal body** of the stomach, equidistant from the lesser and greater curvatures (to minimize risk of arterial injury!) 
	- avoid punctures that transgress the colon or left lobe of the liver
	- minimize risk of hemorrhage by avoiding the inferior epigastric artery (courses the junction btw the medial 2/3 and lateral 1/3 of the rectus muscle)

- infiltrate local anesthesia (1% lidocaine) down to the peritoneal surface, and make a small (but big enough to accommodate for dilators!) nick
- gastropexy
	- <u>devices</u>: Saf-T-Pexy T-fasteners (Avanos) or an 18-gauge needle pre-loaded with a T-fastener (Cook)
	- **2-4 T-fasteners** are deployed to fix the anterior gastric wall to the abdominal wall
	- with the beam in an **LAO configuration** projecting over the gastric body, line the T-bar fastener up with the beam (angled **toward the pylorus**) and advance slowly under fluoro until resistance is met
	- then rotate the C-arm to **RAO** to visualize gastric wall tenting/double density in real time and to assess the depth of the T-fastener. while tenting the gastric wall, have the fastener connected to **tubing w an empty syringe** and advance with **continuous suction** until air is aspirated. then connect a **syringe with contrast and inject** to ascertain intragastric position
- \[OPT] at this point, if preprocedure imaging was not obtained and location of the transverse colon is uncertain, can opt to perform **cone-beam CT** just to gain a better idea of whether a safe window is present
	- \[üìü **vijay**] generally, it's fine to check after placing the T-tacks, not a huge deal if needles that size stick the colon
	- \[üìü **holzwanger**] \* is nervous about sticking colon even with a 22G needle \*

> **TIP: using the hemostat to decide on a location for the T-fasteners and tube** <span class="inf">üåê<span title="" class="footnoteContent">Image Source: BackTable Vascular & Interventional. "Gastrostomy Tube Placement (G-Tube) by Interventional Radiology | BackTable Demo".</span></span>
> If using 2 T-tacks, can plan location with the 2 holes of the hemostat, and the G-tube can fit in the area between them. 


- percutaneous gastrostomy
	- line up an 18G needle with the beam in the **LAO** view projecting over the gastric body at the entry site, and angle the needle toward the antrum/pylorus. advance the needle slowly in this direction until resistance is met. Rotate the C-arm to RAO, watch for tenting, provide continuous suction with a syringe until air is aspirated, then inject with contrast to confirm intraluminal location (**opacification of rugae**)
	- once proper location is confirmed, advance a wire (e.g. **0.035 stiff Amplatz**) through the needle into the stomach with ample purchase (fine to loop it a bit). remove the needle over wire.
	- warn the patient, then perform sequential dilation over the wire using stiff dilators followed by a peel-away sheath
		- peel-away should be 4Fr larger than the gastrostomy catheter ‚Äî eg. a 16Fr catheter requires a 20Fr peel-away, or an 18Fr catheter requires a 22Fr peel-away
		- serial dilation can e.g. be done with 20Fr dilator, 22Fr dilator, 22Fr peel-away
		- **careful when pushing dilator!** because of the thick muscular wall of the stomach, the dilator can easily push the stomach forward rather than dilating the puncture hole within the wall, which can cause the guidewire to prolapse outside the stomach into the peritoneum. to prevent this, ensure the guidewire is sufficiently stiff, have anough wire in the stomach, and watch under fluoro while pushing the dilator
	- advance the gastrostomy catheter over the wire through the peel-away sheath sufficiently, ensuring the balloon is well in the lumen but not past the pylorus
	- inflate the balloon with the maximum recommended amout of sterile water +/- contrast (usually 5cc for 16Fr, 10cc for 18Fr), then pull back the catheter slowly until resistance is met and the balloon is secured against the lining of the near gastric wall
- following tube placement, inject contrast through the new g-tube under fluoro to confirm appropriate position. flush with saline.
- the tube is secured to the skin either with sutures or with a retaining device
	- ensure retaining device is not cinched down too tightly! you do not want to cause pressure necrosis at the site
- attach the catheter to a drainage bag

###### balloon dilation of the tract
if the tract is dilated instead with a balloon 
- typically used a 6mm x 40mm or 7mm x 40mm Mustang (Boston Scientific) to place a 16Fr tube
- gastrostomy catheter is advanced into the tract as the balloon is being deflated
- may result in a tighter gastrostomy catheter access tract, potentially preventing leakage in the future

###### other procedure modifications
- number of T-fasteners
- pull-type gastrostomy tube

#### exchange


### postprocedure care
- if placed for <u>feeding</u> ‚Üí gravity drainage/low intermittent wall suction and NPO for **24h** before use of the tube for enteral feeds (done to remove gastric products)
	- if placed for <u>SBO</u> ‚Üí low intermittent wall suction should be started early and continued as needed
- <u>24h post-procedure</u>: 
	- perform **focused abdominal exam** to assess for peritoneal signs and associated potential malposition of tube
	- get labs: H&H, WBC count (can be mildly elevated)
	- pneumoperitoneum seen on imaging is not abnormal, slowly resolves over 24-72h
- if patient has no concerning findings at this time and output not tremendously high, begin **2h sterile water trial** (25cc bolus in first hour, 25cc bolus in second hour) ‚Äî watch for signs of peritoneal irritation or leakage
- if patient tolerates trial, tube feeds can be started slowly
	- initially usually 10mL/h, then increased as tolerated by 10mL/h per shift to goal rate as determined by Nutrition team
- watch for symptoms: reflux, aspiration, nausea, bloating
	- if symptoms persist over several days after initiating feeding, assess patient for presence of ileus
	- if signs suggestive of ileus absent, consider starting agents to increase gastric motility
	- if motility agents not successful in decreasing tube residuals, consider conversion of G-tube to GJ-tube to allow for distal feeding + proximal decompression
- no specific postprocedural pain management typically required
- <u>follow-up</u>: typically at **3-4 weeks**
	- T-fasteners fall off after 2-3 weeks ‚Äî residual parts removed if they haven't dislodge completely
	- check functioning of catheter, any complaints/symptoms
- especially in a patient with ascites, may want to wait **6-8 weeks** for tract to fully mature
- <u>long-term follow-up</u>
	- typically, routine exchanges are NOT performed, and tube is changed once team/patient/caretaker calls with issues (typically in 4-6 months)
	- IR should proactively follow nevertheless to troubleshoot issues

#### common issues
- failure of retention device & dislodged tube
- tube completely pulled/fallen out
- leaking around tube at insertion site
- tube clogging
- patient not tolerating feeds / has diarrhea
- abdominal pain
- skin irritation/breakdown at insertion site

### complications
- 

### outcomes
- technical success of PRG and PGJ placement approachs 100%
