# percutaneous gastrostomy tube
---

> [!info] definition
> a type of [[percutaneous enteral tube placement\|enteric tube]] with internal tip in the lumen of the stomach used for feeding, medication administration, or venting



### indications
- nutritional support for patients with inadequate oral intake to due dysphagia, risk of aspiration, or obstruction secondary to
	- stroke / neuromuscular disorders
	- esophageal mass/neoplasm
	- lesions of the head, neck, and mediastinum (including recent surgery or radiation)
- diversion of feedings from esophageal leaks caused by recent surgery or trauma
- decompression of gastroenteric contents and/or need for jejunal feeding
	- gastric outlet or proximal [[small bowel obstruction\|small bowel obstruction]]
	- patients with [[gastroparesis\|gastroparesis]], e.g. diabetic gastropathy, [[scleroderma\|scleroderma]]
- intestinal access for biliary procedures (e.g. patients with Roux-en-Y anastomosis)

#### alternatives


### contraindications
#### absolute
- unsatisfactory anatomy, a.k.a. no safe window to access stomach due to interposed colon, liver
- uncorrectable coagulopathy

#### relative
- **prior gastric surgery** with anatomic distortion (e.g. subtotal gastrectomy or gastric bypass)
	- access to the stomach may be very difficult and require advanced techniques and/or CT guidance
- **massive [[ascites\|ascites]]** (though preprocedural paracentesis and gastropexy can help reduce incidence of peritoneal leakage) 
- **gastric or abdominal wall varices** due to portal hypertension
- **inflammatory, neoplastic, or infectious involvement of the gastric wall**: may result in <u>poor wound healing</u> and tract formation
- severe **gastroesophageal reflux**: feeding should instead be delivered into the jejunum via GJ tube or J tube
- [[ventriculoperitoneal shunt\|ventriculoperitoneal shunt]]

### relevant anatomy & pathophysiology


### preprocedure preparation
- review surgical history (prior abdominal/gastric surgery, etc)
- review prior imaging for evidence of altered gastric anatomy, safe percutaneous access route, and ascites
- review and correct any coagulopathy as needed
- \[OPT] ~200mL dilute barium suspension can be given 12h before the procedure to outline the colon
- maintain NPO ~8h prior to procedure
- an NG tube (preferably placed bedside the evening before procedure) is needed for insufflating air to bring the stomach into apposition with the anterior abdominal wall, displacing adjacent viscera, and facilitating creation of a safe window
	- alternatively, can place an angiographic catheter under fluoro immediately prior to the procedure to be used for insufflation

in patients with [[head and neck cancer\|head and neck malignancies]] and/or respiratory compromise:
- be judicious in giving conscious sedation ‚Äì this can be performed safely and comfortably with minimal sedation
- or maybe have anesthesia on hand if minimal conscious sedation is not possible

### procedure

> [!tech] g-tube for venting
> \[üìü **mccarthy**] often, the normal g-tubes tend to be **bad for venting** bc they are too short and gastric contents are dependent and collect posteriorly in a supine patient ‚Äî opt for a modified tube!

#### primary placement
##### tube choice
- <u>sizing</u>
- <u>brand</u>
	- **Entuit gastrostomy catheter** (Cook, Bloomington, IN)
	- Deutsch catheter (Cook)
	- 12Fr multipurpose locking loop multipurpose drainage catheter may also be used



> [!tech] on marking the liver
> **why do it?** ideally, you don't want the tract going through liver parenchyma 
> **does it really help?** preprocedure imaging and/or in-procedure cone beam are probably more useful, but it helps to have a general idea when trying to figure out where to stick

<br>
##### setup
- <u>prep</u>: L subcostal area + epigastrum
	- some attendings prefer whole upper abdomen
- \[OPT] US abdomen to check for and/or mark **liver margins** and **epigastrics**
- in a patient with significant ascites, perform **paracentesis**

##### steps
- when ready for insufflation, **glucagon** (0.5-1.0mg) or butylscopolamine (20mg) can be administered IV to diminish gastric peristalsis
- insufflate air into the stomach via NG until adequate gastric distension is achieved fluoroscopically
- following insufflation, **frontal and oblique views** (+ rarely a lateral view) of the upper abdomen are helpful to determine depth of the anterior gastric wall and location of the transverse colon
- select a puncture site, ideally over the **distal body** of the stomach, equidistant from the lesser and greater curvatures (to minimize risk of arterial injury!) 
	- avoid punctures that transgress the colon or left lobe of the liver
	- minimize risk of hemorrhage by avoiding the inferior epigastric artery (courses the junction btw the medial 2/3 and lateral 1/3 of the rectus muscle)

- infiltrate local anesthesia (1% lidocaine) down to the peritoneal surface, and make a small (but big enough to accommodate for dilators!) nick
- gastropexy
	- <u>devices</u>: Saf-T-Pexy T-fasteners (Avanos) or an 18-gauge needle pre-loaded with a T-fastener (Cook)
	- **2-4 T-fasteners** are deployed to fix the anterior gastric wall to the abdominal wall
	- with the beam in an **LAO configuration** projecting over the gastric body, line the T-bar fastener up with the beam (angled **toward the pylorus**) and advance slowly under fluoro until resistance is met
	- then rotate the C-arm to **RAO** to visualize gastric wall tenting/double density in real time and to assess the depth of the T-fastener. while tenting the gastric wall, have the fastener connected to **tubing w an empty syringe** and advance with **continuous suction** until air is aspirated. then connect a **syringe with contrast and inject** to ascertain intragastric position
- \[OPT] at this point, if preprocedure imaging was not obtained and location of the transverse colon is uncertain, can opt to perform **cone-beam CT** just to gain a better idea of whether a safe window is present
	- \[üìü **vijay**] generally, it's fine to check after placing the T-tacks, not a huge deal if needles that size stick the colon
	- \[üìü **holzwanger**] \* is nervous about sticking colon even with a 22G needle \*
