---

> [!info] definition
> - **diagnostic paracentesis** = aspiration of a small volume of fluid from the [[peritoneum\|peritoneum]] to aid in the diagnosis and management of ascites and other intraabdominal conditions
> - **therapeutic paracentesis** = removal of a large volume of fluid from the peritoneum to relieve symptoms caused by [[ascites\|ascites]]
> - **large-volume paracentesis** = removal of > 5 L of fluid from the peritoneum during one procedure

> [!help]- questions
> - If patient is supine, lowest point of dependent fluid collection is **Morrison's pouch**


### indications


### contraindications
#### relative


#### absolute
- disseminated intravascular coagulation
- fibrinolysis

### relevant anatomy & physiology


>[!idea] remember
> If patient is supine, lowest point of dependent fluid collection is **Morrison's pouch**


### preprocedure preparation
- thorough review of patient’s history, indication for procedure, history of prior procedures, surgeries, and medications should be conducted
- review of previous imaging to assess volume of ascites and anatomy
- pre-procedure labs: **INR, platelet count**
- ensure patient is instructed to hold the appropriate medications
	- prophylactic high-dose aspirin: hold for **7 days**
	- clopidogrel: only hold (**5 days**) if out of cardiac stent safety window
	- warfarin: hold **5 days** OR reduce dose until INR between **1.5 and 2.0**
		- can bridge with heparin or LMWH
	- heparin: hold **2 hours**
	- LMWH: hold **12 hours**
- obtain informed consent
- examine abdomen for signs of infection, 

### procedure
- positioning: **supine**


#### pitfalls and troubleshooting


### postprocedure care
