# transjugular intrahepatic portosystemic shunt (TIPS)
---

> [!info] definition
> percutaneous method of reducing portal vein pressure for treatment of complications of [[portal hypertension\|portal hypertension]]


### clinical indications
- efficacy determined by controlled trials:
	- secondary prevention of [[variceal bleed\|variceal bleeding]] resulting from [[portal hypertension\|portal hypertension]]
	- refractory cirrhotic [[ascites\|ascites]]
- efficacy assessed in uncontrolled series:
	- refractory *acutely* bleeding varices
	- portal hypertensive gastropathy
	- bleeding gastric varices
	- refractory hepatic hydrothorax
	- [[hepatorenal syndrome\|hepatorenal syndrome]] (type 1 or 2)
	- [[budd-chiari syndrome\|budd-chiari syndrome]]
- unclear, variable efficacy described in small series or case reports
	- veno-occlusive disease
	- hepatopulmonary syndrome
	- prophylactic preoperative decompression
	- restoration of portal vein patency prior to transplantation or during catheter-directed therapy of splenomesenteric thromboses

#### alternatives
- [[balloon-occluded retrograde transvenous obliteration\|balloon-occluded retrograde transvenous obliteration]]

### contraindications
#### absolute
- severe or rapidly progressive liver failure
- severe or uncontrolled encephalopathy
- heart failure
- severe pulmonary hypertension

These contraindications hold for most surgical portosystemic diversion procedures
Patients with very advanced stages of liver disease will not tolerative deprivation of nutrient portal flow that occures after total or partially decompressive shunts; in these cases, shunts may accelerate liver failure and should be considered only as last measures, ideally as bridges to imminent transplantation

#### relative
- contraindication to angiographic procedures
	- recent MI, serious arrhythmia, substantial electrolyte balance
	- past serious documented contrast reaction — prophylaxis required, or TIPS creation done using CO2
	- uncorrectable coagulopathies
	- inability to lie flat on angiographic table due to congestive heart failure or compromised respiratory status (intubation may be required)
	- pregnancy (risk of exposing fetus to ionizing radiation)
- conditions that may increase technical difficulty of creating a TIPS
	- biliary obstruction
	- hepatic/pancreatic malignancy
	- polycystic liver disease
	- inferior vena cava or hepatic vein thrombosis

In cases of caval, hepatic vein, or portal system thomboses: modified procedures using transcaval, transhepatic, or transsplenic approaches have been described
Targeting can be further aided by use of intravascular ultrasound (IVUS) for creation of TIPS in routine approaches, DIPS, or complex anatomy

### relevant anatomy & physiology



### pre-procedure prep
1. Obtain consent
2. Preprocedure sonography, CT, or MR imaging to assess portal vein patency and hepatic parenchyma (because HCC incidence increased in patients with cirrhosis)
3. Provide standard hemodynamic monitoring, including EKG, spO2, BP, and possibly capnography as appropriate for adminsitration of sedation per hospital protocols
4. In acutely bleeding patients: ensure satisfactory resuscitation efforts are being undertaken prior to starting
	- may include blood/plasma transfusions, pressor support, placement of balloon tamponade catheters
	- generally, platelets corrected to **> 50,000/microL** and INR to **≤ 1.5**
5. Provide IV antibiotic prophylaxis
6. Appropriate sedation
	- TIPS can be created under conscious sedation with IV fentanyl and medazolam
	- when anesthesia support available, many centers use general anesthesia, especially for pediatric patients, or MAC with propofol
7. Assemble required components
	- TIPS set: several kits exist, but most important factor governing kit choice is operator preference
	- metallic stents
	- guidewires for portal entry are matter of operator preference
8. Preprocedure echo, in elective cases, is obtained at the discretion of the operator, especialy if elevated right-sided heart pressures and pulmonary hypertension are suspected

> - major complications include
> - minor complications include

### procedure
- preferred access: **right internal jugular vein**
	- alternative/additional: transhepatic, transsplenic
- sonographically-guided puncture of the internal jugular vein is performed

### postprocedure care
