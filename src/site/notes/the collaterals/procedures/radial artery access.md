---

> [!info] definition
> arterial access gained through the radial artery

### clinical indications


#### alternatives
- distal radial artery access
- brachial artery access
- axillary artery access

### contraindications


### relevant anatomy & pathophysiology
#### normal anatomy


#### anatomic variants


### pre-procedure preparation

- **Allen test**

### procedure
#### setup
- radial access kits commercially available
	- 1.5 in 20- to 22-gauge access needle w. short bevel
	- 0.018 to 0.025 microwire
	- 4 to 6 Fr hydrophilic introducer sheath (has tapered transition between introducer & sheath)
- figure out how you will position patient / where you will be standing
	- arm out 90 degrees
	- arm across body, stand on contralateral side

#### technique
- place hand supine on an arm board and taoed in a dorsiflexed position with a rolled towel or dedicated support under the wrist
- superficially inject lidocaine to numb the area
- access achieved with US vs. palpation at a 45- to 70-degree angle
- gently advance guidewire under US or fluoroscopy
- remove needle and advance the radial access sheath over the wire, then flush
- administer **radial cocktail**: CCB + vasodilator + heparin
	- e.g. **2.5 mg [[verapamil\|verapamil]] + 0.25 mg [[nitroglycerin\|nitro]] + 2500-5000 IU [[heparin\|heparin]]**
	- \[📟 bulman] 2.5 mg verapamil + 0.20 mg nitro + 3000 IU heparin

> [!tip] tip
> Before pushing the cocktail (esp the heparin), aspirate a decent amount of blood to dilute the med before adminstering to minimize pain/burning from vessel irritation

A. The hand is placed supine and in slight dorsiflexion with a towel or dedicated splint. Palpation or US guidance is then used to get micropuncture access into the radial artery
B. axial and C. longitudinal views
D. Using the Seldinger technique, a sheath is advanced over the wire for stable access into the artery
