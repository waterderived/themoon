## general principles
### handling wires & catheters during selection


#### maneuvers
- 

### approach to selecting devices
selecting a particular catheter depends on 
- the angle of origin of the target artery
- the access site (femoral v. radial/brachial)

#### parameters


## by vessel course


## by anatomic region

### head & neck


### upper extremities


### thorax
#### arch vessel cannulation


### abdomen

#### visceral vessel cannulation
> [!hint] 110-rule for selective visceral artery cannulation (Chuang et. al.)
> The length of the catheter tip distal to the primary curve and the curve width should be **110% of the native artery width** at the level of the target branch vessel




### pelvis



#### renal arteries




### lower extremity
