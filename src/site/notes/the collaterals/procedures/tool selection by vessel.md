# getting into vessels

## general principles
### handling wires & catheters during selection


#### maneuvers
- 

### approach to selecting devices
selecting a particular catheter depends on 
- the angle of origin of the target artery
- the access site (e.g. femoral v. radial/brachial)

principles
- the primary curve of the catheter must approximate the takeoff angle of the targeted vessel to allow for selection and maintenance of the tip within the ostium of the vessel
#### parameters to consider


## by vessel course


## by anatomic region

### head & neck


### upper extremities


### thorax
#### arch vessels


### abdomen

#### visceral vessels
> [!hint] 110-rule for selective visceral artery cannulation (Chuang et. al.)
> The length of the catheter tip distal to the primary curve and the curve width should be **110% of the native artery width** at the level of the target branch vessel

##### mesenteric


##### hepatic
- **aortic branches (celiac trunk and SMA)** → SOS, Simmons (1 or 2), Cobra
	- **celiac trunk**: usually comes off anteriorly and superiorly at ~T12
	- **SMA**: usually comes off anteriorly and inferiorly at ~L1
	- good practice to perform angio of both when exploring hepatic arteries
- navigating smaller branches
	- microwire: **Fathom**
	- microcatheters
		- **Renegade Hi-Flo**
		- **Progreat**
		- **Direxion, Direxion Hi-Flo**

#### bile ducts
- **Kumpe** (KMP)

### pelvis



#### renal artery cannulation




### lower extremity
