# celiac plexus neurolysis
---

> [!info] definition
> different from [[celiac plexus block\|celiac plexus block]] in terms of <u>duration of action</u>
> - **block**: <u>temporary</u> disruption of pain transmission via the celiac plexus and is accomplished by injecting corticosteroids or long-acting local anesthetics
> - **neurolysis**: <u>permanent destruction</u> of celiac plexus with ethanol/phenol


### history
- concept of transcutaneous splanchnic nerve block introduced by Max Kappis in 1914
	- performed technique with external bone landmarks
	- demonstrated that pain from the upper abdominal organs is conducted through splanchnic nerves, & that infiltration of these nerves through a <u>posterior percutaneous</u> approach could be used for surgical anesthesia
- subsequently, Wendling et al described an anterior percutaneous approach for anesthetizing the celiac plexus and splanchinic nerves
	- not widely adopted due to risks
- technique was refined, but didn’t catch on in surgical anesthesia due to advancements in surgical anesthesia

### indications


### contraindications


### relevant anatomy & physiology

Pain that originates from upper abdominal viscera is carried by special visceral afferent fibers that relay through the [[splanchnic nerves\|splanchnic nerves]] and [[celiac plexus\|celiac plexus]]

#### celiac plexus

##### functional anatomy
- largest visceral plexus
- located deep in the [[retroperitoneum\|retroperitoneum]], over the anterolateral surface of the aorta, and near the origins of the celiac axis and the superior mesenteric artery (sma)
- comprises the celiac, superior mesenteric, and aorticorenal ganglia — form a dense network of interconnecting nerve fibers
	- predominantly composed of the preganglionic sympathetic efferent nerve fibers — derive from the greater splanchnic (T5-T9), lesser splanchnic (T10-T11), and least splanchnic (T12) nerves
	- preganglionic parasympathetic efferent fibers from the posterior trunk of the vagus nerve also contribute
- visceral afferent fibers that carry nociceptive stimuli from the upper abdominal viscera (distal esophagus → transverse colon) pass through celiac plexus, along with the splanchnic nerves, before terminating in the spinal cord

Thus, **the celiac plexus supplies sympathetic, parasympathetic, and visceral sensory afferent fibers to the upper abdominal viscera, including the pancreas, liver, biliary tract, gallbladder, spleen, adrenal glands, kidneys, mesentery, stomach, and the small and large bowels proximal to the transverse colon**

##### gross morphologic features

Celiac plexus resides in the retroperitoneal space and is embedded in the fat anterior to the aorta, just caudad to the level of the origin of the celiac artery
- anteriorly: stomach, pancreas
- posteriorly: separated from the vertebral column by diaphragmatic crura
	- important anatomic barriers between celiac plexus (in antecrural space) and the splanchnic nerves (in retrocrural space)

Celiac plexus + its network of ganglia extend over the anterolateral aspect of the aorta for <u>several centimeters</u> (demonstrate considerable variability in size, number, and position)
