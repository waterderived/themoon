# vascular closure devices (VCD)
---

> [!info] definition
> devices designed to help achieve hemostasis for larger arteriotomies



### indications
approved for arterial access site closure and hemostasis after **retrograde common femoral artery puncture** or **radial artery puncture**
- **CFA**: VCDs most often employed for arteriotomies **6F or greater**, but can be used for smaller arteriotomies
- **radial artery**: only *entirely external* VCDs are employed

##### off-label uses


#### alternatives


### contraindications



### devices
#### types
- **active approximators** (mechanical suture-mediated or slip devices)
- **passive approximators** (mechanical plug devices)
- **compression assist devices**
- **hemostatic patches**
- mechanical compression aids

### summary

> [!important] key take-home points
> - The literature has firmly established that VCDs decrease time to hemostasis and ambulation when compared to the gold standard of MC
> - After 20 years of device evolution and collective operator experience, data now suggest that the devices are not different from MC in terms of efficacy, safey, or vascular complications
> - With dozens of devices to choose from, the key to successful VCD deployment is familiarity with the concept, mechanism, and instructions for each device used in one's practice
> 	- Knowing the steps of deployment is insufficient — the operator must be able to visualize what is happening inside and around the artery as each button is pushed and each plunger is depressed
> - Some devices are better suited than others for certain clinical applications and patient populations
