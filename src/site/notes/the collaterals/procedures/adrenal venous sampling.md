# adrenal venous sampling
---

> [!info] definition
> sampling of blood from the adrenal veins bilaterally and a peripheral vein (e.g. the IVC) to obtain and compare aldosterone:cortisol ratios


### clinical indications
- suspicion for **primary hyperaldosteronism** (high aldosterone, hypokalemia)

#### alternatives


### contraindications


### relevant anatomy & physiology


### pre-procedure preparation
- labs
	- potassium
	- aldosterone
	- renin
- **ensure patient is OFF of mineralocorticoid agents (spironolactone, eplerenone, amiloride)** for at least **6 days**
- pre-procedure imaging not really necessary

### procedure
#### the scott trerotola method
- access the R femoral vein & catheterize the IVC
- insert a 5F sheath
- **right adrenal vein access**
	- catheter choice: **5F renal double curve (RDC)**, mickelson, C1, HS2, SIM1, SIM2
	- when preparing the catheter, create a small hole 1mm from the catheter tip on the **superior** surface using a 0.025 in hole punch
		- given the shape/anatomy of the right with a very short trunk, catheters tend to slip into the inferior branch from the common trunk, causing inaccurate reading. the sidehole allows for flow from both the endhole (inferior) and from above
		- published right adrenal sampling failure rates up to 70% (~5% in best hands)
	- place catheter in IVC above the level of the renal vein and turn catheter 1/8 counterclockwise (right adrenal is located 7-8 o'clock). while pulling down catheter, evaluate for deflection on the adrenal vein, then inject contrast gently to evaluate location when deflection occurs
	- OR begin in hepatic vein with catheter oriented toward person's right — you will first see it deflect as it passes out of hepatic vein, then again when it gets into an inferior accessory hepatic vein (present in 60% patients). the adrenal is usually within 1cm of the IAHV.
- **right adrenal vein sampling**
	- perform gentle aspiration, assessing for tactile feedback (chattering)
	- if free aspiration occurs, catheter has likely dislodged into the IVC

- **left adrenal vein access**
	- catheter choice: **Simmons 3**, 
	- when preparing the catheter, create a small hole on the **undersurface** of the catheter tip
	- can either target sampling from the adrenal or from the adrenal-phrenic trunk, but you DON'T want to end up in the phrenic
	- once in the IVC, torque the catheter so that it catches/loops on itself to prevent it from going into the hepatic veins, then once past them, unravel the loop by advancing the wire into the catheter
	- select the left renal vein, then continue pulling down until the tip pops up into the adrenal-phrenic trunk
- **left adrenal vein sampling**

#### considerations
- quality control of sample collection is essential!!


### post-procedure care


### result interpretation
**lateralization** determines patient may be a surgical candidate

### complications


### summary
