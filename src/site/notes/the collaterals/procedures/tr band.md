> [!info] definition
> an entirely external [[the collaterals/procedures/vascular closure devices\|vascular closure device]] often used for hemostasis following radial artery access

### mechanism


### features


### deployment
- upon completion of the procedure, withdraw the introducer sheath 2-3 cm
- \[OPT] place a small thin gauze over the puncture site
	- this way, when watching for bleedback, won't get blood everywhere and no need to wash it off
- apply the TR BAND device by aligning the green marker, which is located on the center of the compression balloon (large) 1-2 mm proximal to the puncture site, and fix the strap on the wrist with the adjustable fastener (tight enough to keep the band from spinning)
- take up 15-**18mL** air into the kit syringe, then inject all of it into the balloon
- remove the sheath, ensuring there is no bleeding/oozing upon doing so. if bleeding continues, inject 1-2 cc more air or readjust the band
- begin titration of air by removing ~1 cc per second while observing the access site for bleeding. once bleeding occurs, inject 1-2cc of air until bleeding stops
- confirm radial pulse and evaluate radial artery patency by using the reverse Barbeau test
