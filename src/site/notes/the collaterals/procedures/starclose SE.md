> [!info] definition
> a [[the collaterals/procedures/vascular closure devices\|vascular closure device]]

### mechanism
a nitinol clip is deployed around the arteriotomy, cinching it closed

### features
- secure mechanical closure
- immediate reaccess possible

#### considerations
- check for known hypersensitivity to nickel-titanium ([[nitinol\|nitinol]]) prior to usage

### deployment
1. exchange the procedural sheath for a StarClose sheath over a 0.035 inch guidewire
2. remove the inner dilator and wire
3. insert the StarClose device until it clicks into the sheath
4. deploy the locator wing by pressing down on the blue plunger at the back of the device â€” ðŸ’¥ a click will be heard
5. pull the device back until resistance is met at the vessel wall
6. shuttle the thumb advancer forward splitting the sheath â€” ðŸ’¥ a click will be heard
7. deploy the clip by increasing the angle of the device and pressing the blue button â€” ðŸ’¥ a click will be heard

#### manual release
If the device cannot be retracted after clip deployment, a manual release will need to be performed
- a small dilator is inserted into the manual release hole on the side of the device
