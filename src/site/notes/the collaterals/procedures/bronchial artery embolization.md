# bronchial artery embolization (BAE)

> [!info] definition

### clinical indications
frequently used in management of **[[hemoptysis#^318b2f\|massive hemoptysis]]** & major hemorrhagic hemoptysis
- **massive hemoptysis** = hemoptysis <u>greater in volume than 250cc in 24h</u>
- **major hemorrhagic hemoptysis** = hemoptysis <u>at least 3x in a week with at least 100cc in 24h</u> 

### contraindications
- non-bronchial artery source of bleeding
- history of severe contrast allergy
- contraindications to general anesthesia or IV conscious sedation

### relevant anatomy & physiology

massive hemoptysis, in a majority of cases, is related to underlying abnormality that involves the

### procedure
goal: to achieve **temporizing/palliative** control
- completely curative treatment requires addressing underlying disease via medical/surgical means

#### steps
1. obtain arterial access via transfemoral or transradial approach. place an intravascualr arterial access sheath
2. introduce an angiographic flush catheter, and position the catheter tip in the transverse or descending thoracic aorta. **perform DSA of the thoracic aorta** (may be unnecessary if detailed bronchial and systemic arterial supply has already been identified with prior imaging)
3. identify bronchial arterial anatomy (i.e. origin, number, course). identify any systemic arterial recruitment (e.g. internal mammary or other subclavian artery branches)

4. use a 4 or 5 Fr catheter to selectively catheterize a bronchial artery and **perform dsa**
	- catheter configurations typically used are <u>curved</u> (e.g. cobra) or <u>reverse-curved</u> (sos, simmons, mikaelsson) 
	- some operators recommend that volume & flow rate for contrast injection should be <u>sufficient to reflux to the vessel origin</u> and thereby increase the likelihood of identifying any spinal artery supply
5. advance a microcatheter coaxially through the parent catheter, and position the catheter tip distal to the bronchial artery origin 
	- tip postition important, as it is intended to minimize the chance of unwanted retrograde reflux into the systemic circulation
6. once abnormal or suspicious vessels are identified, perform embolization through the microcatheter. mixing embolic agent with the liquid contrast medium allows direct visualization and monitoring of the flow of the embolic agent during injection
	- **solid microspheres** most commonly used
	- coils not routinely used unless there is a need to treat an aneurysm or pseudoaneurysm, or for treatment of recruited non-bronchial collateral
	- liquid embolic agents (e.g. absolute alcohol) and very small particles are avoided d/t risk of ischemia/infarction with extremely distal embolization
7. embolization end point generally felt to have been reached once there is no longer forward intraarterial flow (aka stasis is achieved)
	- at this point, any additional injection of embolic agent would result in retrograde reflux and possibility of nontarget embolization

### outcomes



### complications
- intercostal artery embolization (→ chest pain) or esophageal artery embolization (→ dysphagia)
	- usually self-limited, managed conservatively with analgesics
- **==spinal artery embolization==** --> **[[transverse myelitis\|transverse myelitis]]** (most feared complication)
	- reported incidence ranges from 1.4-6.5%, but this data includes some of the early BAE experience in which coaxial microcatheter systems were not routinely used for super-selective embolization -- now felt to be lower


### misc
- originally introduced in franc by Remy et. al. (1973)
- followed closely in the US by Wholey et al, and since has become mainstay for controlling massive hemoptysis
