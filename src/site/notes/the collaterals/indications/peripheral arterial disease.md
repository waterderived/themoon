# peripheral arterial disease
---

> [!info] definition
> condition characterized by the atherosclerotic narrowing of peripheral artries, most commonly of the lower extremities


### epidemiology


### etiology
- **atherosclerosis**
	- atherosclerosis in the aorta and peripheral arteries → insufficient tissue perfusion → PAD
	- often coexists with [[coronary artery disease\|coronary artery disease]], [[stroke\|stroke]], [[atrial fibrillation\|atrial fibrillation]], and renal disease
- risk factors for PAD
	- age ≥ 65 years
	- age 50-64 years with risk factors for atherosclerosis
	- age ≤ 50 years with [[diabetes mellitus\|diabetes]] plus additional risk factors for atherosclerosis

> [!help] remember
> **Smoking** is one of the most important risk factors for PAD!

### pathophysiology


![Pasted image 20230629225434.png|450](/img/user/kitchen%20drawer/attachments/Pasted%20image%2020230629225434.png)

### clinical features
Up to 20-50% of patients with PAD are **asymptomatic**

#### intermittent claudication
- seen in ~ 10-35% patients
	- specific but not sensitive for PAD — up to 40-50% patients have atypical leg pain
- pain, cramps, or paresthesias distal to arterial occlusion
	- femoropopliteal disease (most common) → typically calf [[claudication\|claudication]]
	- aortoiliac disease ([[leriche syndrome\|Leriche syndrome]])
		- level of the aortic bifurcation or bilateral occlusion of the iliac arteries
		- triad of bilateral buttock, hip, or thigh claudication, erectile dysfunction, and absent-diminished femoral pulses
- worsens upon exertion
	- arterial occlusion reduces oxygen supply to the muscles, so during exercise, then oxygen demand increases, demand cannot be met thus causing pain
- completely relieved by rest and lowering affected limbs
- reproducible on asking the patient to walk the same distance at which symptoms typically occur

#### rest pain
rest pain occurs as disease progresses and indicates **severe ischemia**
- typically occurs first in the toes and forefoot
- worsens with reclining (e.g. while sleeping)
- improves on hanging feet off the bed or standing

#### critical limb ischemia (CLI)
- [[critical limb ischemia\|CLI]] is indicative of limb-threatening arterial occlusion
- characterized by the presence of **any one** of the following:
	- **rest pain** lasting ≥ **2 weeks**
	- nonhealing ulcers
	- tissue loss ([[gangrene\|gangrene]])

#### examination findings
- **trophic changes**
	- ↓ skin temperature, ↓ perspiration
	- ↓ hair on legs, ↓ nail growth, brittle nails
	- atrophied muscles
	- dry atrophic, shiny skin and/or bluish skin discoloration
	- [[livedo reticularis\|livedo reticularis]] (advanced disease)
	- **ganrene, ulcers, necrosis** (end-stage disease)
- **absent or diminished pulses**: examine the distal pulses bilaterally, including
	- upper extremity: brachial artery, radial artery
	- lower extremity: femoral artery, popliteal artery, posterior tibial artery, dorsalis pedis artery
- **buerger sign**
	- with the patient in the supine position, elevate the lower limbs to a 45 degree angle at the hip (leg above the level of the heart)
	- evaluate for pallor of the feet
	- ask the patient to sit up with their legs off the exam table in the dependent position
	- evaluate for time taken for the color to return to the feet and for the veins to become distended
	- positive buerger sign if
		- skin pallor on limb elevation
		- reactive hyperemia on limb dependency
		- venous filling time of > 20 seconds may indicate advanced ischemia
- **bruit** over the affected artery may be heard in > 60-70% cases with PAD

### classification
Several classification systems for PAD

#### classification by presentation
- asymptomatic (confirmed PAD in n asymptomatic individual)
- claudication
- [[critical limb ischemia\|critical limb ischemia]]
- [[acute limb ischemia\|acute limb ischemia]]

#### rutherford classification of chronic limb ischemia
Rutherford classification classifies PAD into acute and chronic limb ischemia – emphasizes that they require different treatment algorithms

- **grade 0**
	- **category 0**: asymptomatic; no hemodynamically significant occlusive disease
		- normal treatmill or reactive hyperemia test
	- **category 1**: mild claudication
		- completes treadmill exercise
		- AP after exercise > 50 mmHg but at least 20 mmHg lower than resting values
- **grade I**
	- **category 2**: moderate claudication
		- between categories 1 and 3
	- **category 3**: severe claudication
		- cannot complete standard treadmill exercise
		- AP after exercise < 50 mmHg
- **grade II**
	- **category 4**: ischemic rest pain
		- resting AP < 40 mmHg
		- flat or barely pulsatile ankle or metatarsal PVR
		- TP < 30 mmHg
- **grade III**
	- **category 5**: minor tissue loss — non-healing ulcer, focal gangrene with diffuse pedal ischemia
		- resting ankle pressure < 40 mmHg
		- flat or barely pulsatile ankle or metatarsal pulse volume recording
		- toe pressure < 30 mmHg 
	- **category 6**: major tissue loss — extending above transmetatarsal level, functional foot no longer salvageable
		- same as category 5

#### tasc (trans-atlantic inter-society consensus) II classification
classifies patients according to lesion location and burden
breaks down LE PAD into 3 subsets (**aortoiliac, femoral-popliteal, tibioperoneal**) and 4 severities (A-D)

![[Pasted image 20230611214021.png\|Pasted image 20230611214021.png]]

#### fontaine classification
- stages
	- stage I: asymptomatic
	- stage II: pain on exertion
		- IIA: claudication at distance > 200 m
		- IIB: claudication at distance < 200 m
	- stage III: pain at rest (mostly in feet)
	- stage IV: necrosis and/or gangrene

#### svs wound, ischemia, foot infection (wifi) classification
- purpose
	- quantification of disease burden
	- evaluation of the risks and benefits of revascularization procedures
- description
	- the following factors are assigned values from 0 (normal) to 3 (severe abnormality)
	- benefit of revascularization and risk of amputation can be estimated based on the 3 derived values


### evaluation
#### approach


#### [[ankle brachial index\|ankle brachial index]] (ABI)
**ABI** = the ratio of systolic ankle blood pressure to systolic brachial blod pressure

##### resting ABI
- indications
- techniques
	- ask the patient to rest in the supine position for ~ 10 minutes
	- place the blood pressure cuffs on the ankles and the arms
	- locate the pulse using the Doppler
	- inflate the cuff until the pulse is no longer audible on the Doppler device, and then inflate the cuff by another 20 mmHg
	- deflate the cuff clowly, and note the pressure at which the pulse is audible again
		- ankle pressure
			- measure systolic pressure of bilateral brachial arteries
			- note the higher systolic pressure of either the [[dorsalis pedis artery\|dorsalis pedis artery]] or the [[posterior tibial artery\|posterior tibial artery]] of each leg
		- brachial pressure
			- measure systolic pressure of bilateral [[brachial artery\|brachial arteries]]
				- use the highest arm bp reading for calculations
				- low pressure may represent subclavian or axillary artery stenosis, the prevalence of whic is increased in patients with PAD
			- note the higher brachial blood pressure of either arm
	- calculare the ABI for each leg
		- divide the highest ankle pressure by the highest brachial pressure

###### interpretation of resting ABI
- **> 1.4**: **medial calcific sclerosis** with noncompressible wall (often in elderly patients and patients with diabetes or CKD) — nondiagnostic for PAD
	- → obtain toe-brachial index
- **1-1.4**: normal; **0.91-0.99**: borderline
	- → if typical claudication → obtain exercise ABI
	- → lower extremity wound suggestive of CLI → obtain toe-brachial index or measure tissue perfusion
	- → atypical symptoms → evaluate for ddx of PAD
- **≤ 0.9**: abnormal
	- → typical claudication → **PAD confirmed**, further diagnostics not routinely required
	- → CLI → obtain imaging to plan for revascularization

> [!tip] note
> A low ABI (≤ 0.9) and high ABI (> 1.4) are associated with an increased risk of all-cause and cardiovascular mortality!

#####  exercise ABI
- ABI testing following extended exercise of the lower extremity
- indication: suspicion of PAD in a patient with a normal or borderline ABI
- findings: either of the following are consistent with ABI:
	- post-exercise **decrease by > 20%**
	- post-exercise **decrease in ankle systolic bp by > 30 mmHg**

##### toe-brachial index
- ratio of the systolic blood pressure of the first toe to the systolic brachial blood pressure
- indications
	- suspicion of PAD in a patient with a normal or elevated ABI (i.e. ABI > 1.4)
	- lower extremity wound suggestive of CLI
		- CLI is commonly associated with falsely elevated ABI, so toe-brachial index may be considered even if ABI is not > 1.4
- findings: TBI **≤ 0.70** is consistent with PAD

#### measures of tissue perfusion
- transcutaneous oximetry, fluorescent imaging of indocyanine green dye, dkin perfusion pressure
- indication: nonhealing wounds or tissue loss suggestive of CLI

#### imaging
- indications
- **angiography**: preferred modality for assessment for revascularization
	- modalities
		- first-line: **MR angiography** (MRA) w/wo IV contrast
		- contraindications for MRI (e.g. previous stent placement) → CT angiography with IV contrast (CTA)
		- digital subtraction angiography: considered the **gold standard** for PAD, but uncommonly used (invasive procedure with inherent risks of radiation and iodinated contrast material)
	- findings: demonstration of site(s) and extent of arterial occlusion or stenosis and collateral blood flow
- **duplex ultrasound**
	- indications
		- patients with contraindications for angiography (e.g. contrast allergy)
		- postoperative surveillance of bypass graft patency
	- limitations: low sensitivity for multilevel stenoses and aortoiliac disease
	- findings: elevated peak systolic velocity (PSV) and PSV ratio suggest PAD

**Stenosis of the superficial femoral artery** | MR angiography abdominal aorta with runoff of a patient with load-dependent right leg pain when walking
There is stenosis of the right superficial femoral artery (red overlay). Consequently, the deep femoral artery and its branches (green overlay) show increased blood flow and tortuosity. Collateral filling (anterograde and retrograde arrows) of the (superficial) femoral artery distal to the stenosis is seen.
1: aorta; 2: common iliac artery; 3: external iliac artery; 4: internal iliac artery; 5: common femoral artery; 6: deep femoral artery; 7: (superficial) femoral artery

**Multilevel peripheral arterial disease of the lower limbs** | MR angiography lower limbs
Numerous stenoses (examples indicated by arrows) are present, and portions of several bilateral pelvic, femoral, and lower limb arteries are not visible.

![[Pasted image 20230624163808.png\|300]]

**Peripheral arterial disease with iliac occlusion** | Digital subtraction angiography (pelvis)
There is occlusion of the left internal (IIA) and external (EIA) iliac arteries (locations indicated by green overlay) with collateral blood flow.

![[Pasted image 20230624163906.png\|300]]

**Aortoiliac occlusive disease** | Angiography (upper: abdomen; lower: pelvis)
The abdominal aorta is occluded below the level of the renal arteries (yellow overlay). Collateral circulation (examples indicated by blue overlay) allows for reconstitution of the femoral arteries (red overlay).
Dashed outline: superior mesenteric artery; green overlay: occluded aorta

### management
#### overview


#### risk modification


#### structured exercise therapy


#### vasodilators


#### revascularization
The primary goal of revascularization is to improve blood flow in at least one artery to the foot to prevent pain and tissue loss
- **indications**
	- CLI if limb is viable
	- lifestyle-limiting claudication despite optimal medical therapy and exercise
- **modalities**: endovascular or surgical revascularization
	- choice of procedure depends on the location and morphology of the arterial disease and the patient’s comorbidities
	- staging systems e.g. WIfI classification are used in conjunction with anatomic staging to determine the most appropriate technique

##### endovascular procedures
- [[percutaneous transluminal angioplasty\|percutaneous transluminal angioplasty]] 
	- +/- combination with stent placement and/or atherectomy
- indications: considered with
	- **short segment disease**: stenosis < 10 cm or occlusion < 5 cm
	- aortoiliac disease
	- high-risk patients (predicted periprocedural mortality risk ≥ 5% and 2-year survival ≤ 50%)
		- several comorbidities (e.g. coronary artery disease, congestive heart failure, severe pulmonary disease, chronic kidney disease)

##### surgical revascularization
- **peripheral artery bypass surgery**: open surgical bypass of the vascular stenosis with an autologous vein or prosthetic material
	- autologous vein grafts are associated with better long-term outcomes than prosthetic graft materials
- OR endarterectomy (+/- endovascular treatment)
- indications
	- consider in low- and average-risk patients with any of the following
		- extensive and complex disease (long segment lesions > 10 cm), multifocal lesions
		- lesions of the [[common femoral artery\|common femoral artery]]
		- purely infrapopliteal disease
		- chronic total occlusion
	- unsuccessful endovascular revascularization
