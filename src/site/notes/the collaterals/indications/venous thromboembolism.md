# venous thromboembolism (VTE)
---

> [!info] definition
> umbrella term used to describe [[deep venous thrombosis\|deep vein thrombosis]] with or without [[pulmonary embolism\|pulmonary embolism]]
> - **recurrent VTE** = VTE that recurs in a patient after the completion of the first 2 weeks of antithrombotic therapy
> - **provoked VTE** = VTE in an individual with ≥ 1 risk factor for VTE
> - **unprovoked VTE** = VTE in an individual without risk factors for VTE

### main subtypes
- [[deep venous thrombosis\|deep venous thrombosis]]
- [[pulmonary embolism\|pulmonary embolism]]

### etiology
any factor that causes [[hypercoagulability\|hypercoagulability]], endothelial damage, or [[venous stasis\|venous stasis]] can cause VTE (aka **[[virchow triad\|virchow triad]]**)

#### transient risk factors
- surgical factors
	- surgery under general anesthesia
	- cesarean delivery
- **immobilization**
	- acute illness requiring complete bed rest
	- lower extremity injury with restricted mobility for ≥ 3 days
	- long-distance travel
- estrogen-related factors
	- pregnancy
	- use of OCPs or HRT
- intravascular devices
	- indwelling venous catheter
	- implanted pacemaker or cardiac defibrillator leads
- patient factors
	- obesity
	- smoking
	- IV drug use
	- nonadherence to VTE prophylaxis

#### chronic risk factors
- patient factors
	- age > 60 years
	- personal or family history DVT or PE
- prothombotic chronic illnesses
	- **active cancer**: gastric, pancreatic, pulmonary, hynecological, and urologic tumors in particular are associated with an increase risk for DVT because these types of tumors produce proteins and cytokines with thrombophilic effects
	- [[nephrotic syndrome\|nephrotic syndrome]]
	- autoimmune disorders
	- hereditary thrombophilia
		- **[[factor v leiden\|factor v leiden]]**
		- [[antithrombin iii deficiency\|antithrombin iii deficiency]], [[protein c deficiency\|protein c deficiency]], [[protein s deficiency\|protein s deficiency]]
		- prothrombin mutation

### pathophysiology


> [!tip] virchow triad
> 1. **hypercoagulability**: increased platelet adhesion, thrombophilia (e.g. factor V leiden mutation), use of oral contraceptives, pregnancy
> 2. **endothelial damage**: inflammatory or traumatic vessel injuries can lead to activation of clotting factors through contact with exposed subendothelial collagen
> 3. **venous stasis**: varicosis, external pressure on the extremity, immobilization (e.g. hospitalization, bed rest, long flights or bus rides), local application of heat (induces venous dilation, slowing of flow)
