# deep venous thrombosis (DVT)
---

> [!info] definition
> a form of [[the collaterals/indications/venous thromboembolism\|venous thromboembolism]] involving the formation of one or more blood clots in a deep vein, typically of the lower extremities
> - **proximal DVT**: DVT of the lower extremity affecting the femoral vein, profunda femoris vein, and/or the popliteal vein (up to the calf vein trifurcation)
> - **distal DVT**: DVT of the lower extremity that is confined to the vein beyond the calf vein trifurcation (i.e. below the knee joint)


### etiology
any factor that causes [[hypercoagulability\|hypercoagulability]], endothelial damage, or [[venous stasis\|venous stasis]] can cause VTE (aka **[[virchow triad\|virchow triad]]**)

#### transient risk factors
- surgical factors
	- surgery under general anesthesia
	- cesarean delivery
- **immobilization**
	- acute illness requiring complete bed rest
	- lower extremity injury with restricted mobility for ≥ 3 days
	- long-distance travel
- estrogen-related factors
	- pregnancy
	- use of OCPs or HRT
- intravascular devices
	- indwelling venous catheter
	- implanted pacemaker or cardiac defibrillator leads
- patient factors
	- obesity
	- smoking
	- IV drug use
	- nonadherence to VTE prophylaxis

#### chronic risk factors
- patient factors
	- age > 60 years
	- personal or family history DVT or PE
- prothombotic chronic illnesses
	- **active cancer**: gastric, pancreatic, pulmonary, hynecological, and urologic tumors in particular are associated with an increase risk for DVT because these types of tumors produce proteins and cytokines with thrombophilic effects
	- [[nephrotic syndrome\|nephrotic syndrome]]
	- autoimmune disorders
	- hereditary thrombophilia
		- **[[factor v leiden\|factor v leiden]]**
		- [[antithrombin iii deficiency\|antithrombin iii deficiency]], [[protein c deficiency\|protein c deficiency]], [[protein s deficiency\|protein s deficiency]]
		- prothrombin mutation

### pathophysiology


> [!tip] virchow triad
> 1. **hypercoagulability**: increased platelet adhesion, thrombophilia (e.g. factor V leiden mutation), use of oral contraceptives, pregnancy
> 2. **endothelial damage**: inflammatory or traumatic vessel injuries can lead to activation of clotting factors through contact with exposed subendothelial collagen
> 3. **venous stasis**: varicosis, external pressure on the extremity, immobilization (e.g. hospitalization, bed rest, long flights or bus rides), local application of heat (induces venous dilation, slowing of flow)

### clinical features
- may be asymptomatic
- **localized unilateral symptoms**
	- typically affects deep veins of the legs, thighs, or pelvis
	- **swelling**, feeling of tightness or heaviness
	- **warmth, erythema**, possibly livid discoloration
	- progressive tenderness, **dull pain**
	- distention of superficial veins
	- distal pulses are normal
- **general symptoms**: fever
- possibly **signs of pulmonary embolism**: dyspnea, chest pain, dizziness, weakness

#### pretest probability of DVT

**Wells criteria** (Wells score for DVT) is used to calculate pretest probability of DVT of the lower extremities

> [!example] modified Wells criteria for DVT
> - history of active cancer → +1
> - previous documented DVT → +1
> - paralysis, paresis, or recent immobilization of lower extremity (e.g. cast) → +1
> - recently bedridden for ≥ 3 days OR underwent major surgery within the past 12 weeks under general/local anesthesia → +1
> - tenderness localized along the deep vein system → +1
> - swelling of the entire leg → +1
> - calf swelling ≥3cm compared to the contralateral leg → +1
> - pitting edema confined to symptomatic leg → +1
> - distended collateral superficial veins (nonvaricose) → +1
> - alternative diagnosis as likely as or more likely than DVT → -2
> 
> **interpretation**: 0: low; 1-2: intermediate; ≥3: high

### evaluation
#### diagnostic approach to suspected lower extremity DVT


#### initial evaluation
Based on patient pretest probability, initial test may be either **D-dimer** or **compression ultrasound**

##### D-dimer


#####  lower extremity venous ultrasound
- indications
- procedures
- ultrasound findings supportive of DVT
- accuracy

#### additional evaluation


### management
#### approach


#### expectant management


#### secondary prevention


#### advanced therapy
- **catheter-directed thrombolysis**
- **[[DVT thrombectomy\|DVT thrombectomy]]**
- **[[ivc filter placement\|IVC filter placement]]**

#### supportive care


#### disposition


### prevention
VTE prophylaxis refers to the primary prevention of DVT or PE in at-risk individuals, and includes general preventive measures, mechanical VTE prophylaxis, and pharmacoloical VTE prophylaxis
It should be chosen based on presence of risk factors for VTE and estimated risk of bleeding on anticoagulation therapy
- general preventive measures
	- regular exercise
	- early postoperative mobilization
	- physiotherapy
	- avoid certain medications (e.g. OCPs)
- pharmacologic prophylaxis
- mechanical prophylaxis

#### duration of prophylaxis in hospitalized patients
- mechanical: until patient is mobile
- pharmacological: 
	- seriously ill medical patients: **at least 7 days** (extend to span duration of hospitalization)
	- surgical patients: consider extended therapy for **> 3 weeks**
		- based on type of surgery, degree of restricted mobility, etc


### subtypes and variants
- phlegmasia alba dolens
- [[phlegmasia cerulea dolens\|phlegmasia cerulea dolens]]
- [[paget-schroetter disease\|paget-schroetter disease]] (upper extremity dvt)

### complications
- [[pulmonary embolism\|pulmonary embolism]]
- [[post-thrombotic syndrome\|postthrombotic syndrome]]
- [[venous gangrene\|venous gangrene]] (rare complication)
