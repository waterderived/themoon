**intranodal lymphangiography** takes advantage of the fact that contrast medium injected into lymph nodes is subsequently distributed by the efferent lymphatics

### procedure

Using a high-freq (10-12 MHz) linear US probe, largest inguinal LN is targeted
Access to bilateral inguinal LNs directly made using a fine (21-25G) needle (arrows), using shallow angle to stabilize the needle
Needle tip positioned in the transitional zone, between the hypoechoic cortex and the hyperechoic medulla

Under fluoro guidance, test dose of contrast (Lipiodol Ultra-Fluid) injected slowly to confirm typical beaded appearance of efferent lymphatics in one or more channels

Fluoro demonstrates advancement of contrast column through lymphatics
Transit time is variable but cisterna chyli and thoracic duct are opacified (arrow)

Access to lymphatic system obtained thorugh cisterna chyli or tributaries using a 22-gauge, 15-20 cm Chiba needle
Though technically more challenging bc of smaller size of these feeders, approach inferior to the cisterna may reduce the potential of inadvertent leak after access is removed

A 0.018in long wire is advanced into the thoracic duct coaxially through needle

After needle removal, a microcatheter is introduced over the wire. 
Contrast medium is injected into the thoracic duct though the catheter to identify the chylous leak (star)

Metallic microcoils are placed proximal to the point of occlusion or contrast extravasation in the thoracic duct
N-butyl cyanocrylate (n-BCA) diluted in lipiodol is also used for embolization (coils provide scaffold for polymerization)

If there is no extravasation or venous filling, access needle is connected to an injection pump. 0.10-0.30 mL/min infusion rate recommended
Intermittent fluoro monitoring required to exclude inadvertent extravasation or venous shunting, in which case a new lymph node must be injected
Total dose of lipiodol should be limited to 0.25 mL/kg
Normal saline or contrast media may be used to propel residual oil-based contrast to cisterna chyli

### postprocedural care
- postembolization pain generally mild
- <u>assessing output from pleural drainage tubes</u> after embolization is critical -- if no increase, patient's diet may be advanced, chest drains removed
- in patients without chest tube, <u>serial chest radiographs</u> to monitor procedure success
	- primary cause of persistent leak after embolization: parallel ducts or leakage from percutaneous access to cc

*above*: contrast extravasation (arrow) from hole created by previous access of the cisterna chyli. note contrast in cc from the first thoracic duct embolization (arrowhead)

### results
- tde only with coils has lower clinical success rate than combo of coils + n-BCA (84% vs 91%)
- overall intent-to-treat success rate 71%
	- success rate directly relates to ability to catheterize cc and td
	- when technically successful, clinical success 90%
- nontraumatic chylothorax: clinical success rate of 52% (favorable compared to 27% where combined conservative and surgical management employed)

### complications
- pedal lymphangiography --> infection risk
- overfilling of lymphatics with oil-based lipiodol --> pulmonary distress
- embolization of the pulmonary artery
- failed cannulation of the TD --> chylous ascites
- may be associated with protein-losing enteropathy, lymphedema, and chylous ascites (--> chronic diarrhea, lower extremity edema, abdominal swelling)

##### management
- risk of pulm artery embolization with n-BCA reduced by use of coils prior to n-BCA
- manage nontarget embolization expectantly
